	<h2>About the project</h2>

	<p>
    If you thought that Bumblebee was dead, it's still alive and kicking! See
    <a href="http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org/FAQ">http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org/FAQ</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The project has been fully rewritten in the C programming language, providing
    increased performance and reliability, mostly thanks to a new developer in the
    project, Jaron Vi&euml;tor (a.k.a. Thulinma). That bring the number of main developers to
    4, the three other ones being Peter Wu (a.k.a. Lekensteyn), Joaqu&iacute;n Ignacio
    Aramend&iacute;a (a.k.a. Samsagax) and Bruno Pagani (a.k.a. ArchangeGabriel).

  <p>
    The most important new feature is automatic power management support. Yes, since
    Bumblebee 3.0 "Tumbleweed", you've got Power Management working out of the box,
    without any manual configuration needed. That's not the only one though, the
    full changelog could be found at <a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/release-notes-3.0">http://bumblebee-project.org/release-notes-3.0</a>
