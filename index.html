      <h1>Announcing Bumblebee 3.2.1 - <i>"Tumbleweed"</i></h1>
      <img src="bumblebee3banner.jpg" alt="Bumblebee 3 release banner">
<p>The Bumblebee Project proudly presents version 3.2.1 of Bumblebee, a project
aiming to support NVIDIA Optimus technology under Linux.</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<p>Bumblebee 3.2.1 has been released on 26 April 2013. (<a
href="http://bumblebee-project.org/release-notes-3.2.1">release notes</a>)<br>
This version fixes the main issue of Bumblebee 3.2.<br />
Previous release notes available <a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/release-notes-3.2">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>If you thought that Bumblebee was dead, it's still alive and kicking! See
<a href="http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org/FAQ">http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org/FAQ</a></p>

<p>The project has been fully rewritten in the C programming language, providing
increased performance and reliability, mostly thanks to a new developer in the
project, Jaron Vi&euml;tor (a.k.a. Thulinma). That bring the number of main developers to
4, the three other ones being Peter Wu (a.k.a. Lekensteyn), Joaqu&iacute;n Ignacio
Aramend&iacute;a (a.k.a. Samsagax) and Bruno Pagani (a.k.a. ArchangeGabriel).</p>

<p>The most important new feature is automatic power management support. Yes, since
Bumblebee 3.0 "Tumbleweed", you've got Power Management working out of the box,
without any manual configuration needed. That's not the only one though, the
full changelog could be found at <a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/release-notes-3.0">http://bumblebee-project.org/release-notes-3.0</a></p>

<p>This rewrite of the project was an occasion for updating available
documentations, wikis and instructions that can be found on the web. However,
please be aware that we cannot update all sites that exist and that a lot
misinformation is still spread. The best way to be sure to have the latest
instructions is checking <a href="http://wiki.bumblebee-project.org">our wiki</a> or follow us at
<a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/twitter">Twitter</a>,
<a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/facebook">Facebook</a> or
<a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/g%2B">Google Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, packages for ArchLinux, Ubuntu, Mandriva and many others have been packaged.
<a href="/install.html">Installation instructions can be found here!</a></p>

<p>We currently do not accept donations. The Paypal account referred by the
tinyurl "Bumblebee Project" belongs to Martin Juhl (MrMEEE), former
developer of Bumblebee and his own fork, Ironhide.</p>

<p>The team is looking for users having the necessary knowledge to build packages
for other popular distributions, if you're interested please join
#bumblebee-dev on Freenode. We'll then link our documentation to the one from
your distribution.</p>

<p>If you run into problems, be sure to read

Although we aim at stability, (compatibility) issues may still occur which can
